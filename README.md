# InfraMind GPU Agent

InfraMind GPU Agent is a lightweight, Linux-based observability agent designed to monitor and analyze GPU infrastructure in real time.

Modern DevOps and monitoring tools focus heavily on CPU and memory, leaving GPUs as blind spots — despite their high cost and critical role in AI workloads. InfraMind aims to close this gap by providing deep visibility into GPU utilization, memory usage, thermal health, and running workloads.

## Why InfraMind?

- GPUs are expensive and often underutilized
- GPU failures are detected too late
- Existing tools lack GPU-first insights
- AI workloads need proactive infrastructure intelligence

InfraMind starts with visibility and evolves toward predictive and self-healing GPU infrastructure.
